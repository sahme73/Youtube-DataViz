Click here https://cen.yt/functioneamonbec6 and subscribe to get 20% off your first custom 16oz set + free shipping!\n\nThe hardest words I've heard lately have been \"you have breast cancer\" but this was followed closely by \"you will lose your hair.\" For as long as I can remember I have had long, healthy hair, and as I learned on this hair loss journey... this was a big part of my identity. But what scared me more about losing all my hair to chemotherapy was that once I was bald I would be easily identified as a cancer patient. Knowing that anyone could quickly see what I was going through and feel 'sorry for me' or 'sad for me' scared me even more. \n\nThis story begins with cutting 16 inches off my hair to hopefully make a wig from my own hair. I then share a beautiful wig we've gotten to help me through those moments where I just want to feel a little 'normal' again.
